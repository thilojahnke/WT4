Valuation of customers in OpenUI5
#
This app was created while following the Walkthroug tutorial for OpenUI5. It is just for learning propose and there is no productive use.
 It can create customer records with a customer number and two name fields. You can put each customers in a worklist and valuate each record from one to six.
#
INSTALLATION
You need a small database and an odata service running on your server. If you dont have such a configuration I recommand using the testing mode.
Copy the content of the folder WebContent in your server and create a web.xml . If your using eclipse you can import the .project file. 
#
Testing mode
in eclipse you can use /test/mock.html for testing without an odata server running. Just configure a runtime service with jetty and start the app on localhost.
