Valuation of customers in OpenUI5
<br>
This app was created while following the Walkthrough tutorial for OpenUI5. It is just for learning propose and there is no productive use.
 It can create customer records with a customer number and two name fields. You can put each customer in a worklist and valuate him from one to six.<br>
##INSTALLATION<br>
You need a small database and an odata service running on your server. If you dont have such a configuration I recommand using the testing mode.
Copy the content of the folder **WebContent** in your server and create a web.xml . If your using eclipse you can import the .project file. 
##Testing mode<br>
in eclipse you can use /test/mock.html for testing without an odata server running. Just configure a runtime service with jetty and start the app on localhost.
